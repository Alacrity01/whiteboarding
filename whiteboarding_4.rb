# Whiteboarding Questions 4

# Everyone should pair up to take turns whiteboarding the following problems and identifying the efficiency of each algorithm in terms of Big O Notation. (Take turns on doing each one.)

# 1. Write a function that accepts an array as a parameter and returns true or false depending on whether there are any duplicate values. Use the *nested loops approach* as described in the slides.

# 2.  Write a function that accepts an array as a parameter and returns true or false depending on whether there are any duplicate values. Use the *hash approach* as described in the slides.

# 3. Write a method that accepts a string as a parameter and returns an array containing each character as a separate value, but the character must also be capitalized.

# 4. Write a method that accepts an array of numbers and returns the sum of all odd numbers.
def sum_odds(numbers)
  sum = 0
  numbers.each do |number|
    if number % 2 != 0
      sum += number
    end
  end
  sum
end
# p sum_odds([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])

# 5. (If you didn’t get to it last week) Write a method that accepts two arrays, and returns a new array that does a “riffle shuffle” between them. That is, if the first array is [1, 3, 5, 7, 9], and the second array is [2, 4, 6, 8, 10], the returned array should be [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10].

# BONUS: You can use your computer for this last section. Read about and implement the following sorting algorithms that sort an array of numbers. Be sure to identify the Big O efficiency of each algorithm! 
# * Bubble sort
# * Insertion sort
# * Selection sort
# * Merge sort
# * Quick sort
# * Heap sort
